# KDE Dataset Generator

Generate new dataset from original data keeping the "essence" using `Probability Density Functions` which are estimated using `Kernel Density Estimation`.

## Requisites

- >= `Python 3`.
- `Python Jupyter Kernel`.
- Frontend for `Jupyter Notebooks`.

We recommend `Jupyter Notebook package` which contains all in one (`kernel` and `frontend`).

## Installation

Install Python dependencies:

```sh
cd <project-path>
pip3 install -r requeriments.txt
```
## Usage

Open `proposal.ipynb` (notebook) with your `Jupyter Notebooks` frontend and run it.
